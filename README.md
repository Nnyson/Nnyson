Hi I am Danny studying Cyber security and digital forensics. I'm wanting to be a cyber security analyst or a digital forensics. 
I had learent Ctech It in A level which had introduced me to cybersecurity but I have allways had a passion, I have allways been interested on computing, I have Built a PC with a RTX 4090 and I9 13900k unlocked as I enjoy using over clocked hardware.
